"It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes. I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.

The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.

To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My fatherâs age rendered him extremely averse to delay.

So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw. But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.",Herman Melville,Moby-Dick

Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whaleâs head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there",Herman Melville,Moby-Dick

We have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few forms; and partly because the",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

But their importance for classification, I believe, depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species; and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their conditions of life. That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value, is almost shown by the one fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

A large number of individuals, by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, I believe, an extremely important element of success.

"feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them. That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be cast in the false mold of a European heroâthe supposed ruler of menâthat history has invented. To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of greatness. CHAPTER VI The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of KrÃ¡snoe.

The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve oâclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard.

Bonaparteâs adjutant had not yet reached Muratâs detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In BagratiÃ³nâs detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.

About the same time he received letters from Prince VasÃ­li and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifeâs debts. And Pierre decided that the stewardâs proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his wifeâs affairs and must rebuild in Moscow.

Some flash as of an electric spark shot from TelyÃ¡ninâs eyes to RostÃ³vâs and back, and back again and again in an instant. âCome here,â said RostÃ³v, catching hold of TelyÃ¡ninâs arm and almost dragging him to the window. âThat money is DenÃ­sovâs; you took it...â he whispered just above TelyÃ¡ninâs ear. âWhat? What? How dare you? What?â said TelyÃ¡nin. But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon. As soon as RostÃ³v heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

He cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous.â âOh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.â âYou are speaking of the poor countess?â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, coming up just then. âI sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little better.

But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness?â He paused again. âWho art thou?

This legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between menâs opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile. In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked.

And before RostÃ³v had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing.

In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of SuvÃ³rov. Moreover, paying such honor to BagratiÃ³n was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of KutÃºzov. âHad there been no BagratiÃ³n, it would have been necessary to invent him,â said the wit ShinshÃ­n, parodying the words of Voltaire.

There was a new feature in Pierreâs relations with Willarski, with the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a manâs convictions by words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view.

When conversation turned on her husband HÃ©lÃ¨ne assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance.
