"condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and VÃ©ra. After BorÃ­s came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the RostÃ³vs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties. Berg and VÃ©ra could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room, at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it, especially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the shoulder, and with parental authority superintended the",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"shirts for them. âReady, ready, dear fellow!â said KaratÃ¡ev, coming out with a neatly folded shirt. KaratÃ¡ev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever. âA promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is, ready,â said PlatÃ³n, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn. The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his hesitation,",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"will make the glass run over,â Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued. âThe sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.â âThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,â said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: âThe sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!â and he became more animated. âAnd believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.â And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position. Prince Hippolyte, who had",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"the least conception of what a fugue is. Each instrumentânow resembling a violin and now a horn, but better and clearer than violin or hornâplayed its own part, and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant. âOhâwhy, that was in a dream!â PÃ©tya said to himself, as he lurched forward. âItâs in my ears. But perhaps itâs music",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"ask you to reveal to me your chief passion,â said the latter. âMy passion! I have had so many,â replied Pierre. âThat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path of virtue,â said the Mason. Pierre paused, seeking a reply. âWine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?â He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give the pre-eminence. âWomen,â he said in a low, scarcely audible voice. The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer. At last he moved up to",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. âThere are not many left of us old friends! Thatâs why I so value your friendship.â Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna looked at VÃ©ra and paused. The countess pressed her friendâs hand. âVÃ©ra,â she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, âhow is it you have so little tact? Donât you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...â The handsome VÃ©ra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt. âIf you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,â she replied as she rose to go to her own",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"the sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action. Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"angry glance. âThere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...â âWho sacrificed everything for him,â chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, âthough he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,â she added with a sigh,",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"man can be known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicineânot a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the authorities. âI have taken six lives,â he says (he was a great sinner), âbut what I am most sorry for is this old man. Donât let him suffer because of me.â So he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the papers all in due formâthe authorities I meanâtime passed. The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsarâs decree came: to set",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"for telling me so. And that is the whole point.â The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone. âOn the contrary,â he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, âon the contrary, your excellencyâs participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,â he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence. KutÃºzov bowed with the same smile. âBut that",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
