Looking down over the rails Prince NesvÃ­tski saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men,",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

KutÃºzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who were to watch KutÃºzovâs actions and report upon them. Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized. The posts left vacant by BagratiÃ³n, who had been killed, and by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"the movement of the nations? (1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is his participation in that action. (2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

To the devil, the devil, the devil...â cried the old count. âMy headâs in a whirl!â And he left the room. The countess began to cry. âYes, Mamma!

And there?...â Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible. âThatâs his again,â said the officer.

"taking in a word, she understood only that it was a letter from himâfrom the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand?

Even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general mood of courting Mary HendrÃ­khovna.

PÃ©tya rode beside DenÃ­sov, the pulsation of his body constantly increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid distant objects. Having reached the valley, DenÃ­sov looked back and nodded to a Cossack beside him. âThe signal!â said he. The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides, and then more shots. At the first sound of trampling",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

But as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of Europe, led them to the goal. The goal is reached.
